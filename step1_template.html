<!--Choose your favorite science experiment. How many materials do you need to execute this experiment? Make that many + 2 HTML pages. Each page will display an image of one necessary item and a few images of unnecessary items to throw off the player. Once the player clicks the correct item, they will be sent to the next page where the process will repeat, this time with a different necessary item and different unneccesar items. If the player chooses an incorrect image, you should send them to a "Wrong Answer" page and suggest that they go back and try picking a different image. Once they complete the last page correctly, your code should send them to a final page where they can see the experiment com eto life!-->

<!--Use this as a template for building the "Choose Your Materials" pages-->


<!--CSS adds formatting to make your page look more appealing. This is code to add a background image.-->
<!-- CSS -->	
<style type="text/css">
html, 
body {
height: 100%;
}
body {
background-image: url("  "); /* insert your own background image URL between the " " */ 	
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-size: 100% 100%;
}
</style>

<!--Include a header for your page. What does the player have to do? Write a line of instructions for the activity.-->
<h1 align="center">Lets make a volcano!<h1>

<!--NOTE: If you want to center your header, use the "align=" attribute-->
<!--NOTE: if you choose a dark background image, you may want to add a line to change the font coloring of the words-->

<!--Create your buttons! Find clear images that will be visually apealing and educational to the reader. Copy the image URL into a <button> tag and add attributes for sizing ("style=) and linking to the other pages ("onclick=")-->
<!--Make sure to send your player to the correct pages. Choosing the correct image should send them to Step 2. Anything other image should send them to the Wrong Answer page.-->
